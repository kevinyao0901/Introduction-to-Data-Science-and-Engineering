### Here is My Homework for Lec07.

### 
All running results in [results](https://github.com/kevinyao0901/Introduction-to-Data-Science-and-Engineering/tree/main/machine_learning/results)

~~Because some problem ask to train models,so they might not have output to help you to check their correctness.You can check the code to confirm their correctness anyway.~~

As for the 5th problem of chapter11 ,the prove is in the .md file [5.logistic.md](https://github.com/kevinyao0901/Introduction-to-Data-Science-and-Engineering/blob/main/machine_learning/ch11/5.logistic.md)

I also list the .png running result below for your convenience.However,you are still going to move to the directory to view the .png files if you want to check them.
